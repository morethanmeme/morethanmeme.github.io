  <h1>GameStop - A Short Story</h1>
  <h2>Disclaimers</h2>
  <p>This is <b>NOT</b> financial advice.  Please take the time to read, learn and come to your own conclusions.  The information presented below is strictly a baseline for conversation.</p>
  <p>While there are other "meme stocks" and others (namely AMC) that have the potential for a short squeeze, this will primarily focus on GME (GameStop).</p>
  
  <h3>The Premise</h3>
  <p>This is a super short explanation of the situation and how we got here and how it <i>could</i> play out.</p>
  <p>Going into 2020 some Short Hedge Funds (SHFs) saw an opportunity to take some struggling companies that would be impacted by the pandemic out.  While shorting a stock isn't necessarily bad/evil in and of itself, it can be taken too far and become predatory.  A SHF makes the ultimate profit when they can short a company and have them go bankrupt or become delisted.  Either of those scenarios allows them to tax a max profit from the situation.  So they have a vested interest in seeing a company they are shorting fail.</p>
  <p>GameStop was a company that matched a very good profile for a short opportunity.  They were a brick and mortar based company in an industry that was moving away from physical media to digital.  The leadership at the time wasn't really doing anything to right the ship, so there was blood in the water and the sharks started circling.  They started shorting the stock aggressivly.  Going into January 2021 there was at one point 140% of published short interest in the company.  That alone is pretty remarkable, but the story doesn't end with the squeeze in January.</p>
  <p>What happened in January?  Wasn't there a squeeze and its all over now?  The squeeze in January was not a full short squeeze, but rather a gamma squeeze.</p>
  <h3>Short Squeeze vs Gamma Squeeze</h3>
  <p>A short squeeze is where people with a short position in the company are forced to cover their position (aka sell back the shares the borrowed).  While they are rather infrequent, they do happen.  When they do, its either from the short seller realizing they need to get out of the position and start selling.  But can also come from their lender forcing them to exit their position due to not having enough margain to cover their position.</p>
  <p>A gamma squeeze is slightly different as its triggered by option chains.  Without going into option chains, Market Makers (MMs) that sell options will hedge against their bets.  For options that are near the current strike price they will normally have the shares available if the option goes into the money and they buyer exercies their contract.  For contracts that are further out of the money, they won't fully hedge them as their likelihood of being exercies is less...likely.  But if there is a sudden surge in the price the MMs will scramble to purchase additional shares to fulfill their contracts, thus adding to the buying pressure.</p>
  <h4>January 2021</h4>
  <p>So a few things happened in January that caused the price to spike.  Between the short interest being published and reddit jumping in and gaining traction, the interest in GameStop surged and along with its share price.</p>
  
  <h2>MEME Stocks</h2>
  <p>The term "meme stocks" is most commonly associted with the reddit group, <a href="https://reddir.com/r/wallstreetbets">WallStreet Bets</a> and refers to any stock that gets talked about and uses memes and humor to promote it.</p>
